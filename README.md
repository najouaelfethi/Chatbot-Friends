# Description
Joey Tribbiani is our favorite character in F.R.I.E.N.D.S sitcom, and just like Joey, this project aims to bring a fun and engaging experience. Inspired by his simplicity, humor, and loyalty, we have developed a project that reflects these traits through its intuitive design and seamless functionality. Whether you're a fan of Joey's classic 'How you doin'?' or simply appreciate efficient and enjoyable solutions, this project is built to entertain, inform, and solve problems in the most user-friendly way possible."

# DEMO
Here are screenshots from our chat with the Joey chatbot during testing. It performs well with standard questions and delivers great responses to character-specific queries.
