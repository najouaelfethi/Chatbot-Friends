# Description
Joey Tribbiani is our favorite character in the F.R.I.E.N.D.S sitcom, and just like Joey, this project brings a fun and engaging experience. <br>
We fine-tuned the model using Dialo-GPT, achieving a perplexity of 6.8822, and implemented it with the Transformers library for seamless functionality. The chatbot is deployed on Telegram, offering efficient, user-friendly interactions that reflect Joey's simplicity, humor, and loyalty.

# DEMO
Here are screenshots from our chat with the Joey chatbot during testing.
